  m_Text: 'According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should
    be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don''t care what humans think is
    impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh,
    black and yellow! Let''s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming!
    Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?
    - I can''t. I''ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid
    good money for those. Sorry. I''m excited. Here''s the graduate. We''re very
    proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B''s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing
    going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That''s me! - Wave to us! We''ll
    be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey,
    Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.
    Never thought I''d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school.
    Those were awkward. Three days college. I''m glad I took a day and hitchhiked
    around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a
    mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral?
    - No, I''m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don''t waste it
    on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
    I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That''s why we don''t
    need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well,
    Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty,
    distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating
    class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at
    Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it''s just orientation.
    Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
    - Wonder what it''ll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division
    of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that
    you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can
    work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the
    nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,
    scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive
    golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She''s my cousin! -
    She is? - Yes, we''re all cousins. - Right. You''re right. - At Honex, we constantly
    strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing
    a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we
    have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that
    little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone
    work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that
    every small job, if it''s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because
    you''ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the
    rest of your life? I didn''t know that. What''s the difference? You''ll be happy
    to know that bees, as a species, haven''t had one day off in 27 million years.
    So you''ll just work us to death? We''ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What''s
    the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That''s an insane choice
    to have to make. I''m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
    But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything?
    We''re bees. We''re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever
    think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example.
    I don''t know. But you know what I''m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal
    Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen
    Jocks! - Wow. I''ve never seen them this close. They know what it''s like outside
    the hive. Yeah, but some don''t come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys
    did great! You''re monsters! You''re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder
    where they were. - I don''t know. Their day''s not planned. Outside the hive,
    flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can''tjust decide to be a Pollen
    Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That''s more pollen than you
    and I will see in a lifetime. It''s just a status symbol. Bees make too much
    of it. Perhaps. Unless you''re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
    Those ladies? Aren''t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two.
    - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let''s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being
    a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on
    my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought
    I''d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities.
    I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn''t it, comrades? Yeah.
    Gusty. We''re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles,
    huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you''re not up for it. - Maybe
    I am. - You are not! We''re going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?
    Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex!
    Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you''re interested in? - Well, there''s
    a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same
    job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and
    you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.
    It''s a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the
    honey field just isn''t right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon
    animals? That''s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son''s not sure
    he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I''m not trying
    to be funny. You''re not funny! You''re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
    - You''re gonna be a stirrer? - No one''s listening to me! Wait till you see
    the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I''m gonna get an ant tattoo!
    Let''s open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I''ll pierce my thorax. Shave my
    antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
    I''m so proud. - We''re starting work today! - Today''s the day. Oome on! All
    the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
    stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two
    left! One of them''s yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What''d you
    get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first
    day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh,
    my. What''s available? Restroom attendant''s open, not for the reason you think.
    - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you''re on. I''m sorry, the Krelman
    just closed out. Wax monkey''s always open. The Krelman opened up again. What
    happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He''s dead. Another dead one. Deady.
    Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That''s
    life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming,
    inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry,
    what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we''ve got the sunflower
    patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I''m going out.
    - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the
    rest of my life. You''re gonna die! You''re crazy! Hello? Another call coming
    in. If anyone''s feeling brave, there''s a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their
    roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn''t that the kid we saw yesterday?
    Hold it, son, flight deck''s restricted. It''s OK, Lou. We''re gonna take him
    up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank
    you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly
    in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds,
    bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on
    us. Murphy''s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That''s awful.
    - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to
    humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz,
    buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot
    shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack,
    check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK,
    ladies, let''s move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All
    of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I''m out! I can''t believe I''m out! So blue.
    I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have
    roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger.
    Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It''s got a bit of a kick. That is
    one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some
    pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that
    one. See that? It''s a little bit of magic. That''s amazing. Why do we do that?
    That''s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for
    us. Oool. I''m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don''t we
    need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
    Say again? You''re reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line!
    This is the coolest. What is it? I don''t know, but I''m loving this color. It
    smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful,
    guys. It''s a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there!
    Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama''s
    little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile!
    Help me! I don''t think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he
    knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you''re
    about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There''s a bee in the car! - Do something! -
    I''m driving! - Hi, bee. - He''s back here! He''s going to sting me! Nobody move.
    If you don''t move, he won''t sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny!
    What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta
    get home. Oan''t fly in rain. Oan''t fly in rain. Oan''t fly in rain. Mayday!
    Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you
    close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.
    You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don''t need this. What was that? Maybe
    this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is
    diabolical. It''s fantastic. It''s got all my special skills, even my top-ten
    favorite movies. What''s number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don''t go for that...
    ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn''t talk to them. They''re out of their
    minds. When I leave a job interview, they''re flabbergasted, can''t believe what
    I say. There''s the sun. Maybe that''s a way out. I don''t remember the sun having
    a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At
    first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter
    boots. Wait! Don''t kill him! You know I''m allergic to them! This thing could
    kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have
    any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I''m just saying all life has
    value. You don''t know what he''s capable of feeling. My brochure! There you
    go, little guy. I''m not scared of him. It''s an allergic thing. Put that on
    your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special
    skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
    - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could
    put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta
    say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes.
    Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It''s a bee law. You''re
    not supposed to talk to a human. I can''t believe I''m doing this. I''ve got
    to. Oh, I can''t do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can''t. How should I start
    it? "You like jazz?" No, that''s no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi!
    I''m sorry. - You''re talking. - Yes, I know. You''re talking! I''m so sorry.
    No, it''s OK. It''s fine. I know I''m dreaming. But I don''t recall going to
    bed. Well, I''m sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise
    to me. I mean, you''re a bee! I am. And I''m not supposed to be doing this, but
    they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn''t for you... I had to thank
    you. It''s just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I''m talking with
    a bee. - Yeah. I''m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want
    to say I''m grateful. I''ll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
    - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You
    pick it up. - That''s very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn''t laugh,
    we''d cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something?
    - Like what? I don''t know. I mean... I don''t know. Ooffee? I don''t want to
    put you out. It''s no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It''s just coffee. - I
    hate to impose. - Don''t be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey,
    you want rum cake? - I shouldn''t. - Have some. - No, I can''t. - Oome on! I''m
    trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don''t help. You
    look great! I don''t know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right?
    No. He''s making the tie in the cab as they''re flying up Madison. He finally
    gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says,
    "Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"
    Is that a bee joke? That''s the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what
    are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don''t know. I want to do my part for
    the hive, but I can''t do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do?
    - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a
    florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected
    with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There''s my hive right
    there. See it? You''re in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I''m right off the Turtle Pond!
    No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings
    on their toes? - Why not? - It''s like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I''ll
    try that. - You all right, ma''am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of
    coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it''s no trouble.
    Sorry I couldn''t finish it. If I did, I''d be up the rest of my life. Are you...?
    Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah.
    All right. Well, then... I guess I''ll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And
    thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not
    nothing, but... Anyway... This can''t possibly work. He''s all set to go. We
    may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!
    It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can''t believe you
    were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They
    talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and
    kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don''t. - How''d you get
    back? - Poodle. You did it, and I''m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
    You had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well...
    - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents
    will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I''m not attracted to spiders.
    I know it''s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can''t get by
    that face. So who is she? She''s... human. No, no. That''s a bee law. You wouldn''t
    break a bee law. - Her name''s Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She''s so nice. And she''s
    a florist! Oh, no! You''re dating a human florist! We''re not dating. You''re
    flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers
    and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands
    me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a
    crumb. - It was so stingin'' stripey! And that''s not what they eat. That''s
    what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It''s bread
    and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen
    to me! We are not them! We''re us. There''s us and there''s them! Yes, but who
    can deny the heart that is yearning? There''s no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen
    to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking
    bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
    There he is. He''s in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta
    start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It''s been three days! Why
    aren''t you working? I''ve got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What
    life? You have no life! You have no job. You''re barely a bee! Would it kill
    you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father''s talking to you. Martin,
    would you talk to him? Barry, I''m talking to you! You coming? Got everything?
    All set! Go ahead. I''ll catch up. Don''t be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! -
    We''re still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn''t respond to yelling!
    - Then why yell at me? - Because you don''t listen! I''m not listening to this.
    Sorry, I''ve gotta go. - Where are you going? - I''m meeting a friend. A girl?
    Is this why you can''t decide? Bye. I just hope she''s Bee-ish. They have a huge
    parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that''s
    every florist''s dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
    A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I''ve got
    one. How come you don''t fly everywhere? It''s exhausting. Why don''t you run
    everywhere? It''s faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo.
    You can just freeze live TV? That''s insane! You don''t have that? We have Hivo,
    but it''s a disease. It''s a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You
    must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It''s usually fatal
    for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take
    a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:
    Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with
    you?! - It''s a bug. He''s not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!
    What was that? A Pic ''N'' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It
    felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You''ve really
    got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I''ll bet.
    What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee,
    Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard
    of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don''t have enough food
    of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes
    it! And it''s hard to make it! There''s heating, cooling, stirring. You need
    a whole Krelman thing! - It''s organic. - It''s our-ganic! It''s just honey,
    Barry. Just what?! Bees don''t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
    You''ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it''s on
    sale?! I''m getting to the bottom of this. I''m getting to the bottom of all
    of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well,
    I guess I''ll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
    You''re busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk.
    And now you''ll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who''s your
    supplier? I don''t understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want
    to do is upset bees! You''re too late! It''s ours now! You, sir, have crossed
    the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the
    honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy
    person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what
    hit them. And now they''re on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You''re
    not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
    To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I''m going to Alaska. Moose blood,
    crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I''m going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really
    is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade!
    - Triple blade? Jump on! It''s your only chance, bee! Why does everything have
    to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes!
    Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I''m Oarl Kasell.
    But don''t kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something?
    - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey,
    Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever
    this truck goes is where they''re getting it. I mean, that honey''s ours. - Bees
    hang tight. - We''re all jammed in. It''s a close community. Not us, man. We
    on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a
    mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack,
    smack! At least you''re out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls
    try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don''t want no mosquito.
    You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood''s about to leave the building! So long,
    bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I''d catch y''all down here. Did you bring
    your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it''s pretty much
    pure profit. What is this place? A bee''s got a brain the size of a pinhead.
    They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That''s
    the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
    Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
    They make the honey, and we make the money. "They make the honey, and we make
    the money"? Oh, my! What''s going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn''t last too
    long. Do you know you''re in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved
    here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That''s a man in women''s clothes!
    That''s a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There''s hundreds of them! Bee honey.
    Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything
    bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans
    are taking our honey? That''s a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That''s a conspiracy
    theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
    He''s been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend.
    And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose
    side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy
    legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
    I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember
    you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn''t stop.
    I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a
    year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it''s true, what
    can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That
    would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That''s a killer. There''s only one place you
    can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive''s only
    full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor
    desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung.
    - Good evening. I''m Bob Bumble. - And I''m Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee,
    Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging
    it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we''ll
    have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy
    Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we''re talking to Barry Benson. Did
    you ever think, "I''m a kid from the hive. I can''t do this"? Bees have never
    been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
    Where I''m from, we''d never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy
    stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which
    will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the
    human world too. It''s a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has
    a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the
    bottom from the guest even though you just heard ''em. Bear Week next week! They''re
    scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes,
    very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother,
    Ken. She''s 81. Honey, her backhand''s a joke! I''m not gonna take advantage
    of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? -
    Yes, it is! I''m helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This
    is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I
    believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go ''cause we''re really
    busy working. But it''s our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
    You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been
    a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the
    competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes
    my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets
    now. Those are great, if you''re three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just
    get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees
    must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that''s had work done.
    Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit''s a pretty big
    deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I''m
    done with the humans, they won''t be able to say, "Honey, I''m home," without
    paying a royalty! It''s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where
    the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear
    for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here,
    Barry? It''s pretty big, isn''t it? I can''t believe how many humans don''t work
    during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good
    lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What''s the matter?
    - I don''t know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn''t the bee team. You boys
    work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase
    number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
    is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you''re representing the five food companies
    collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you''re representing all the bees of
    the world? I''m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we''re ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery,
    your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother
    was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man''s divine right to
    benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy
    world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to
    negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How
    do we know this isn''t some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood
    wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning!
    For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there''s
    no trickery here. I''m just an ordinary bee. Honey''s pretty important to me.
    It''s important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with
    our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can
    take it from us ''cause we''re the little guys! I''m hoping that, after this
    is all over, you''ll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything
    we have but everything we are! I wish he''d dress like that all the time. So
    nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big
    company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes,
    they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing
    term. I don''t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn''t
    hear you. - No. - No. Because you don''t free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,
    it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
    They''re very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean
    like this? Bears kill bees! How''d you like his head crashing through your living
    room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that''s enough.
    Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.
    - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you''ve
    never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven''t. No, you haven''t. And
    so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human
    for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been
    stung, Mr. Sting? Because I''m feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say...
    Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That''s not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first,
    belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank
    you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you''re devilishly handsome with
    a churning inner turmoil that''s ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a
    crime? Not yet it isn''t. But is this what it''s come to for you? Exploiting
    tiny, helpless bees so you don''t have to rehearse your part and learn your lines,
    sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn''t a goodfella. This
    is a badfella! Why doesn''t someone just step on this creep, and we can all go
    home?! - Order in this court! - You''re all thinking it! Order! Order, I say!
    - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that
    bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury''s on our side. Are we doing everything
    right, legally? I''m a florist. Right. Well, here''s to a great team. To a great
    team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn''t think you were coming. No, I was
    just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn''t want all this to go
    to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There''s
    a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear
    you''re quite a tennis player. I''m not much for the game myself. The ball''s
    a little grabby. That''s where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was
    looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn''t
    really a special skill.'
